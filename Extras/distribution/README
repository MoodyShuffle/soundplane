Soundplane 1.0a2
January 9, 2014

changes:

- two new kinds of zones: z (pressure only) and a toggle switch.
- fixed an error where inactive touches were continuously sending their data
- shortened some JSON zone names (just remove "controller_" to fix your presets)
- updated Max/MSP examples 
- moved matrix message into t3d OSC bundle with touches
- restored some debug printing in the in-app console
- added error info for JSON parsing
- fixed possible bug with zone parsing
- clarified the T3D format in docs
- fixed an error reading calibration files
- fix view issues for Retina display


This is a preview release of the Soundplane app with the new mapping and control features. 


To install this version: move the "Soundplane" application to your Applications folder, then move the directory "ZonePresets" to ~/Library/Application Support/Madrona Labs/Soundplane. (To navigate to your Library folder on OS X 10.7 and above, hold down (option) and choose to Go menu in the Finder.)

When you launch the Soundplane application, the menu at the top of the "Zones" page should contain three presets: chromatic, rows in fourths and rows in octaves, followed by a list of all the JSON files in the ZonePresets folder. If the JSON files do not appear, the ZonePresets directory is probably not in the right place. 

The format of the zone files is human-readable and relatively self-explaining. There are two examples so far: 30sliders and zoneExample1.

The Soundplane Max/MSP examples require the CNMAT Max externals to run. These can be found at http://cnmat.berkeley.edu/downloads .

-OpenGL accelerated graphics
-fixed graphics for Retina display
-fixed a bug where SoundplaneController was initialized twice
-fixed OpenGL errors on quit
