-new Zone features allow mapping notes and controllers to key grid
-changed t3d format for wider OSC compatibility
-OpenGL accelerated graphics
-fixed graphics for Retina display
-fixed a bug where SoundplaneController was initialized twice
-fixed OpenGL errors on quit

To install this version: move the "Soundplane" application to your Applications folder, then move the directory "ZonePresets" to ~/Library/Application Support/Madrona Labs/Soundplane. (To navigate to your Library folder on OS X 10.7 and above, hold down (option) and choose to Go menu in the Finder.)

When you launch the Soundplane application, the menu at the top of the "Zones" page should contain three presets: chromatic, rows in fourths and rows in octaves, followed by a list of all the JSON files in the ZonePresets folder. If the JSON files do not appear, the ZonePresets directory is probably not in the right place. 

The format of the zone files is human-readable and relatively self-explaining. There are two examples so far: 30sliders and zoneExample1.

The Soundplane Max/MSP examples require the CNMAT Max externals to run. These can be found at http://cnmat.berkeley.edu/downloads .
