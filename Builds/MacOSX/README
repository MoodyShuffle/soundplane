To build the Soundplane app in XCode, open Soundplane.xcodeproj 
and choose Edit Active Target "Soundplane." Then click "Build" 
to see build settings.  Paths are set up via user-defined settings, 
at the bottom of this list. It is assumed you have a "dev" directory 
in your home directory, and that all other source directories 
are in ~/dev. If this is not true you will need to adjust the paths.

To build and code sign a release version, I use the script 
make-and-sign.sh in this directory.
